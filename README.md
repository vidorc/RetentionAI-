RetentionAI: Customer Churn Prediction
üìñ Overview
RetentionAI is a machine learning project that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (i.e., stop using a service). By identifying at-risk customers, businesses can proactively take steps to retain them, such as offering discounts, improving service, or providing targeted support.

This model uses customer demographic data, account information, and service usage patterns to generate a churn probability score for each customer.

üéØ Business Impact
Customer retention is critical for sustainable growth. It is often more cost-effective to retain an existing customer than to acquire a new one. This model directly supports business goals by:

Reducing Revenue Loss: Minimizing the number of departing customers.

Increasing Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Keeping customers engaged for longer.

Informing Retention Strategies: Providing data-driven insights to marketing and customer success teams.

‚ú® Features
Churn Prediction: Classifies customers as likely to churn or not.

Feature Importance: Identifies the key drivers of churn (e.g., contract type, tenure, monthly charges).

Customer Segmentation: Allows for grouping customers based on their churn risk.

Model Evaluation: Uses metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and AUC-ROC to measure performance.

üíª Technologies Used
Python

Pandas & NumPy: For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.

Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Matplotlib / Seaborn: For data visualization and interpreting results.

(Optional) XGBoost / LightGBM: For building more advanced and accurate models.

üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/RetentionAI.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd RetentionAI

Usage
Train the model using your customer dataset or use a pre-trained model to make predictions on new customer data.

(You will need to create scripts to handle the model training and prediction pipelines.)

Example command for prediction:

# This is a conceptual example. Your script would likely take a file or customer ID as input.
python predict_churn.py --input_file 'new_customers.csv'

üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
The model is trained on a dataset of customer information, which typically includes features like:

Demographics: Gender, Senior Citizen status, Partner, Dependents.

Account Information: Tenure (how long they've been a customer), Contract type (month-to-month, one year, two year), Payment Method, Paperless Billing.

Service Usage: Phone Service, Multiple Lines, Internet Service, Online Security, Tech Support, Monthly Charges, Total Charges.

Target Variable:

Churn: Yes or No.

A classification algorithm (such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting) is trained to learn the patterns that lead to customer churn. The output is a prediction that can be used to flag customers for intervention.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
The predictions from this model are based on historical data and correlations. They should be used as a tool to guide business strategy, not as a definitive judgment of a customer's intentions. Always use these insights responsibly and ethically.
